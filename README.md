##PfumaMuGaba
The rise in popularity of Mukando in Zimbabwe strongly indicates that these savings clubs are quite effective for the majority of the group members. PfumaMuGaba is a secure “piggy bank” mobile application that enables group savings towards a particular similar agenda in which members can make their payments using card, Zimswitch, internal transfer or kiosk cash payments. All the added members automatically become signatories to the savings, anything towards the savings has to be acknowledged for by all members. The application can also be used for keeping track of payments made towards group savings and the dates when payment was initiated. It brings transparency on each member's payment.

##Problem Definition
● Mukando's biggest strength is also one of its greatest drawbacks, it relies on trust.
● Sometimes people in mukando complain about a member, who after reaching their turn to receive a lump sum pull out of the club before the turns come to full rotation.
● People claim they find it difficult to save on their own and need the pressure from other group members.
● Formal businesses fear to create services targeted at Mukando because they seem to have no structure.
● Each savings club has an objective and sets the rules for all the members.
● There are no lengthy forms to be filled in or official documents.
##Solution
● In cases where the Mukando is more formalised with a bank account, the signatories have been trusted not to withdraw all the money and use it outside of the group’s agreement.
● Savings clubs give you access to interest free capital at no extra cost to you.
● Users can join multiple savings groups.
● Users can pay towards savings at the comfort of their homes, using mobile app
internal payment for both usd and zwl payments.
● Securing funds is auto since all the funds go straight to the bank account.
● There is a trace for all payments made.
● The app uses gamification, which encourages users to pay towards their saving
and earning badges which can be redeemed later on as gifts.
